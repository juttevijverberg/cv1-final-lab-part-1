    "### **General Guidelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code must be handed in this Jupyter notebook, renamed to **StudentID1_StudentID2_StudentID3.ipynb** before the deadline by submitting it to the Canvas Final Lab (Part 1) Assignment. Please also fill out your names and IDs above.\n",
    "\n",
    "For full credit, make sure your notebook follows these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please express your thoughts **concisely**. The number of words does not necessarily correlate with how well you understand the concepts.\n",
    "- Understand the problem as much as you can. When answering a question, provide evidence (qualitative and/or quantitative results, references to papers, figures, etc.) to support your arguments. Not everything might be explicitly asked for, so think about what might strengthen your arguments to make the notebook self-contained and complete.\n",
    "- Tables and figures must be accompanied by a **brief** description. Add a number, a title, and, if applicable, the name and unit of variables in a table, and name and unit of axes and legends in a figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late submissions are not allowed.** Assignments submitted after the strict deadline will not be graded. In case of submission conflicts, TAs’ system clock is taken as reference. We strongly recommend submitting well in advance to avoid last-minute system failure issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment:** Since this is a project-based assignment, you are free to use any feature descriptor and machine learning tools (e.g., K-means, SVM). You should use Python for your implementation. You are free to use any Python library for this assignment, but make sure to provide a conda environment file!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plagiarism Note:** Keep in mind that plagiarism (submitted materials which are not your work) is a serious offense and any misconduct will be addressed according to university regulations. This includes using generative tools such as ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ensure that you save all results/answers to the questions (even if you reuse some code).**"

    "### **Report Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your tasks include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Report Preparation:** For both parts of the final project, students are expected to prepare a report. The report should include all details on implementation approaches, analysis of results for different settings, and visualizations illustrating experiments and performance of your implementation. Grading will be based on the report, so it should be as self-contained as possible. If the report contains faulty results or ambiguities, TAs can refer to your code for clarification. Only section 10 of this notebook should **not** be included in the report.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Explanation of Results:** Do not just provide numbers without explanation. Discuss different settings to show your understanding of the material and processes involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quantitative Evaluation:** For quantitative evaluation, you are expected to provide the results based on the mAP (mean Average Precision) metric. You should report the mAP for each experimental setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Qualitative Evaluation:** For qualitative evaluation, you are expected to visualize the top-5 and bottom-5 ranked test images (based on classifier confidence for the target class) per setup. Provide a figure for each experimental setup Visual elements such as charts, graphs, and plots are always useful. Keep this in mind while writing your reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Aim:** Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline using a traditional Bag of Visual Words method.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Working on Assignments:** Students should work in assigned groups for **two** weeks. Any questions can be discussed on ED.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Submission:** Submit your source code and report together in a zip file (`ID1_ID2_ID3_part1.zip`). The report should be a maximum of 10 pages (single-column, including tables and figures, excluding references and appendix). Express thoughts concisely. Tables and figures must be accompanied by a description. Number them and, if applicable, name variables in tables, and label axes in figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Hyperparameter Search:** In your experiments, remember to perform a hyperparameter search to find the optimal settings for your classifier. Clearly document the search process, the parameters you explored, and how they influenced the performance of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Format and Testing:** The report should be in **PDF format**, and the code in **.ipynb format**. Test that all functionality works as expected in the notebook."

    "The goal of this lab is to implement an image classification system that can identify objects from a given set of classes. You will perform a 5-class image classification using a bag-of-words approach ([reference](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/icvss08_az_bow.pdf)). The classes for this task are:\n",

    "The dataset will be automatically downloaded using the code provided in this notebook. You will need to perform training on the training set, which will later be divided into two subsets: one for building the visual vocabulary and another for training the classifier. Using more samples for training generally results in better performance. However, if computational resources are limited, you may use fewer training images to save time, as long as at least 500 images per class are included.\n",

    "### **Section 3: Building the Visual Vocabulary (3 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the task is to create a visual vocabulary by clustering feature descriptors extracted from the images using K-Means. Each cluster center in this vocabulary will represent a visual word. Use the two different extraction techniques you implemented to extract descriptors from a subset of training images that includes all categories, and then apply K-Means clustering to build the vocabulary. The number of clusters is fixed at 1000, but you can experiment with different values when you are tuning the hyperparameters in section 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the effect of different amounts of training data, build separate visual vocabularies using 30%, 40%, and 50% subsets of the training images. For faster clustering, the `faiss` library can be used, as it provides an efficient implementation of K-Means. Then, visualize the first 10 clusters for each feature extraction technique and each subset size using PCA to reduce the dimensions to 2D.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "1. Begin by debugging the code with a small number of input images to ensure it functions correctly before running it on larger datasets.\n",
    "2. If the `faiss` library is not available, K-Means clustering can also be performed using the `sklearn` or `scipy` libraries.\n",
    "3. For visualization, use PCA from `sklearn.decomposition` to reduce the high-dimensional descriptors to 2D. Display up to 10 clusters in the scatter plot to maintain clarity."

    "To extract the visual tokens using the CLIP model, start by initializing two empty lists: one for storing the image features and another for the labels. Use `tqdm` to create a progress bar that tracks the extraction process over the DataLoader. Iterate through the DataLoader, extracting images and labels. Disable gradient computation, and then encode the images with `model.encode_image(images)`. Append the encoded features and labels to their respective lists. Remember, the output from the model will have the shape `(batch_size, 512)` due to batched processing, if your are using a single you should reshape the output to `(512,)` to remove the batch dimension.\n",

    "**Note:** The CLIP model is quite large and may take some time to extract features from the images. You can use the `tqdm` library to create a progress bar that shows the extraction progress. It is recommended to test the code with a smaller subset of images to ensure it functions correctly before running it on the full dataset. With the default batch size of 16 and a training set size of 1000 images, the extraction process may take a 10-20 minutes."
